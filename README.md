# PowerShell
A collection of PowerShell scripts and snippets I've written over the years.  Storing everything here so I don't lose track of it all, and maybe it will be of use to someone else along the way.

| Script | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |  
| Check-SSLConfig.ps1 | Automate SSL-Labs tests on external websites. |
| IIS-Binding.ps1 | Export IIS bindings to CSV |
| (Mostly) One Liners.ps1 | Various one liners I've used over the years to get the job done quickly, and a permanent home for stuff I routinely forget. |
| Get-Certificates.ps1 | Grabs information on certificate configured on a host.  I use it to check my work post renewal. |
